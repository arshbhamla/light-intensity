# NJIT Classroom Lighting Assessment Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to see whether NJIT's classroom lighting meets the recommendations for learning environments. It will assess light levels and uniformity using data collected using a circuit and Arduino. 

## Timeline
- **Data Collection**: Mid-November
- **Analysis & Reporting:** By November 25, 2024
- **Final Report Submission:** December 2, 2024

## Hardware
The circuit uses the following pieces of hardware:
- **KY-018 Photoresistor Module:** Used to collect data light intensity 
- **Arduino Uno:** Receives analog voltage from module and sends lux calculation to computer

## Languages
- Python
- C++ (Using Arduino.h)
